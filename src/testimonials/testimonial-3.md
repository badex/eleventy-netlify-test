My sessions with Therese were both calming and empowering. I've just recently become interested in holistic therapies, so I was sceptical and utterly surprised by the sense of freedom and transformation that bubbles out after each session. From the very first I felt a connection building with Therese as she is such a naturally intuitive and easy-going person. Her initial questions to discover what I needed to work on were very revealing without ever feeling invasive. We laughed together as well as discussing difficult issues, so I experienced the healing itself with a strong feeling of trust and direction.

Afterwards, Therese was able to draw out suggestions or explanations that made me just feel, "YES! That's exactly it!", where I hadn't been able to before.

She has excellent follow up material and exercises and I am definitely a repeat customer.
