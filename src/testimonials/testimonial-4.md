Therese has been a guiding light in my life for years. She is soft spoken and yet firm, with a kind heart, deeply knowlegeable and intuitive. Since embarking on my spritual journey, she has been a welcome teacher, counsellor and confidant. She has opened up to me a world or possibilities I would never have imagined without her.

I am where I am today because of her.
                      
She truly is here to heal the world and immerses herself in her work.

She is a natural born healer and magic woman on earth.
