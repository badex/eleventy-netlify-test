Some say healers are born, others say that healers are made, shaped by life experiences and a desire to help others. I think that Therese is someone that both apply to because her natural physical presence feels both grounded but yet other worldly .One feels in the presence of a gifted healer and her energy seems to heal and nurture without even trying, so Iâ€™d call that a true healers vibration. Her capacity to listen, absorb and remain non judgemental is remarkable. I have benefited enormously from my treatments with Therese and her sound healing will drift you off to another galaxy entirely. I recommend that if you wish to invest in your wellness emotionally, physically and mentally that you book a session with her and just let the magic unfold.
