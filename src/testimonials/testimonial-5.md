Therese has an innate ability as a healer to offer solace and inner peace.

During my last session, I saw the image of a lotus and was thinking about the symbolism of this iconic flower. After the experience ended, Therese told me that a vision of a lotus had also come to her while she was working with me. We then discussed the message of this plant, it growing up through the mud in order to transform. It is a great pleasure to be able to be able to work with people who are deeply connected to the transformational healing of others.
