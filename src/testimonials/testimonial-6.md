Therese is a very warm and open person who makes me feel comfortable straight away. I feel better just talking to her before the healing sessions even begin. My sessions are always so powerful, I love when she places the singing bowls on my body, so I wasnâ€™t expecting as much from the distance healing session I received from her, but I was very pleasantly surprised by how much I benefited from and enjoyed it. I have recommended Therese to my friends and family and anyone who has gone to her has thanked me for putting them in touch. Therese is a natural born healer and I am blessed to have her help on my journey!
